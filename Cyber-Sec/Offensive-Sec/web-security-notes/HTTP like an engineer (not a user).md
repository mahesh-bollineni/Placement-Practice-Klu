HTTP: Request vs Response (Complete Guide)
1️⃣ What is an HTTP Request?

An HTTP Request is sent by the client (browser, app, script) to a server asking for something.

Structure of an HTTP Request
2️⃣ What is an HTTP Response?

An HTTP Response is sent by the server back to the client with the result.
3️⃣ HTTP Methods (VERY IMPORTANT)
🔹 GET

Purpose: Fetch data

Body: ❌ No

Sensitive data? ❌ NO (URL visible)

Idempotent: ✅ Yes

GET /users?id=10 HTTP/1.1


👉 Security risk: Parameters logged, cached, leaked.

🔹 POST

Purpose: Submit data

Body: ✅ Yes

Used for: Login, forms, uploads

Idempotent: ❌ No

POST /login HTTP/1.1
{
  "user": "admin",
  "pass": "123"
}


👉 Most attacked method (SQLi, XSS, auth bypass).

🔹 PUT

Purpose: Replace entire resource

Idempotent: ✅ Yes

PUT /users/10
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "role": "admin"
}


👉 Bug class: Mass assignment, IDOR.

🔹 PATCH

Purpose: Partial update

Idempotent: ❌ Usually no

PATCH /users/10
{
  "role": "admin"
}


👉 Classic privilege escalation target.

🔹 DELETE

Purpose: Remove resource

Idempotent: ✅ Yes

DELETE /users/10


👉 Check: Auth + authorization. Often broken.
5️⃣ HTTP Status Codes (Know These Cold)
✅ 200 OK

Request succeeded

🔁 301 Moved Permanently

Permanent redirect

SEO + cache sensitive

👉 Bug: Open Redirect

🔐 401 Unauthorized

Authentication required

No/invalid token

👉 Check: Can you bypass?

⛔ 403 Forbidden

Authenticated but not allowed

👉 Pentest goal: Turn 403 → 200

💥 500 Internal Server Error

Server crash

👉 Goldmine:

Stack traces

DB errors

Sensitive paths
